# ArduinoBuzzerPiano

In here is the arduino codes I used to play the 5 different songs. Some files might have two different parts of the same song in them(Base and Melody). In that case, comment one part out when uploading so it won't interfere with the music. In order to get a better idea on how to build it, you can check my tinkercad files to experiment with the simulation.

In order to play a note use the method "buzz()" and give it the key you want as a parameter. Then use delays to make spaces. Enjoy the project! :)
